# Yo 👋

I’m Nathan. My website is [nathanherald.com](https://nathanherald.com) (the source of which is at [myobie/nathanherald.com](https://github.com/myobie/nathanherald.com)) and you can read more stuff about me there if you like.

## I ❤️ GH

I’ve been using GitHub since before it was public, I have a very low user ID ([179](https://api.github.com/users/myobie)), I’ve worked at GitHub in the past, and I have a lot of super old public repos I am embarrassed about. All that just to say: I like GitHub and use it everyday. 

**I am not a programmer, but I've pretended to be one for a while.** I’ve even been an “architect” although I hate that title. I see myself as a designer who tries envision systems of working between computers and humans. Programming (along with other skills, tools, and other people) is something which can help me build the things I see in my mind.

I was pretty heavy into ruby and rails for a long time and so there are [a lot](https://github.com/myobie/factories-and-workers) [of old](https://github.com/myobie/turbine) ruby-related repos on my profile. More recently I've been writing a lot of elixir and I love learning about erlang. One day I will finish my [highlander](https://github.com/myobie/highlander) project which I hope could be a distributed elixir registry with uniqueness guarantees so I can design applications where every user or item is backed by it's own elixir process. Or maybe someone else will make it before me which would be fine too 🕶️ 

I'm also writing a lot of typescript and swift and I think I have some repos with those languages. I pretty much hate javascript-related tooling and Xcode setup stuff, but it’s worth it I guess…

## Shareup

My colleagues and I are building a new, fun way to privately share stuff with the people you care most about called [Shareup](https://shareup.app). **Sharing should be easy.** We are sharing code and ideas at [github.com/shareup][shareup profile] as we go. We are pretty excited about some of the tech bets we are making; like betting heavily on wasm, websocket, webrtc, swift ui, elixir + phoenix, and more and we’ll share what we learn over on the [shareup profile][].
